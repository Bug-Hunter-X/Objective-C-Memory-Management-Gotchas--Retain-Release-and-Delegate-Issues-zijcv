In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises from the misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods (or their modern counterparts, `strong` and `weak` properties) in conjunction with custom memory management, especially when dealing with complex object graphs.  The problem often manifests as seemingly random crashes or unexpected behavior due to memory leaks or double-free errors.

For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    // Missing release of myString! Leads to memory leak.
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
// ... later ...
obj = nil; // Object is deallocated, but myString is not, causing leak.
```

Another common problem is failing to handle delegate callbacks correctly. If a delegate object is retained by the delegating object, then a retain cycle may occur, preventing objects from being deallocated.

```objectivec
@interface MyDelegate : NSObject
@end

@implementation MyDelegate
@end

@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) id <MyDelegate> delegate;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)doSomething{

  // if delegate is self, it will cause a retain cycle
  // this leads to memory leak
  [delegate doSomethingElse];
}
@end
```
