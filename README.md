This repository demonstrates two uncommon but significant errors related to memory management in Objective-C. The first example highlights improper use of `retain`/`release` or `strong`/`weak` properties resulting in memory leaks. The second example showcases how incorrect handling of delegate callbacks can lead to retain cycles, preventing objects from being properly deallocated.  Solutions are provided to address these issues.
